# Snakemake Pipeline for Simulatin Arabidosis Thaliana Evolve and Resequence Experiment Across Generations and Environments

This repository contains a Snakemake pipeline for simulating and analyzing the *Arabidopsis thaliana* 231 ecotypes experiment conducted by [GreneNet](http://grene-net.org/).

## Repository Structure

- **Snakefile:** This file is the main configuration file for the Snakemake pipeline. It defines the rules and dependencies for executing the workflow.
- **config.yaml:** This YAML file contains configuration parameters and settings used by the Snakemake pipeline. Modify this file to customize the pipeline for your specific needs.
- **data:** This directory is intended for storing input data files required by the pipeline. Place your input files in this directory before running the pipeline.
- **envs:** This directory contains environment specifications (e.g., conda or docker) required for executing the pipeline. Define the necessary environments in separate files within this directory.
- **log:** This directory is used to store log files generated during the execution of the pipeline. It helps in troubleshooting and monitoring the pipeline's progress.
- **profiles:** This directory contains configuration profiles for different execution environments (e.g., local, cluster, cloud). Use these profiles to define specific resource requirements and execution settings.
- **results:** This directory is the designated location for storing output files generated by the pipeline. The pipeline will automatically place the results in this directory upon successful completion.
- **scripts:** This directory is meant for storing any additional scripts or helper functions that may be used by the Snakemake pipeline.

## Purpose

The purpose of this pipeline is to simulate the [GreneNet](http://grene-net.org/) experiment using *Arabidopsis thaliana* 231 ecotypes. The founder population is grown in 32 different environments, each with 12 replicates. Over 6 generations, allele frequencies are collected for each population. Additionally, 30 different genetic architectures for traits are simulated, incorporating variations in allele frequencies, polygenicity, and effect sizes of the causal loci. The populations are followed for 6 generations, collecting allele frequency data in each.

Furthermore, the pipeline includes benchmarking of different models for detecting causal loci.
