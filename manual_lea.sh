Ok so im gonna try to run the lfmm that is contained in the lea package, for this, im gonna create this manual 

what is the fomrat needed for the package to run ?
in their tutroial they have some sample examples 
so, im gonna try them up in the script: 

lea.R in the lea folder


## lfmm() is Bayesian method that uses a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain algoritm, 
## and lfmm2() is  a  frequentist  approach  that  uses  least-squares  estimates
# (e.g. more than 1,000-10,000 genetic loci), the best is to use lfmm2().


ok so i will fucking do it with my simulations 

so for this i will have to construct a matrix of allele freq in samplesxloci 

## ok so finally i run the LEA but i ran it ina  dumb way where i used a k= 3 , now i should use a k with some sense
